#Getting started

##Install dependencies

    npm install
    npm run typings install

And if you don't already have gulp installed:

    npm install gulp -g

##Running

    npm start

Note that you'll have to use Chrome's dev tools for debugging.  Alternatively, you can just run and debug from within Visual Studio itself (press F5), but there are some drawbacks at this time of writing, so I'm advising against it for now - at least on the front-end (Node.js + TypeScript on the back-end is a different story).
